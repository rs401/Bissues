<h2>About Bissues</h2>
<div class="p-3">
    <p>
        Bissues is a Bug and Issue tracking system for software developers and 
        the users of their software. The purpose is to provide an open line of 
        communication between developers and users, to resolve issues and bugs 
        in a structured iterative manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a user is not getting expected results from a program, the user 
        files an “Issue” and requests support. A “Bug” is an error in code that 
        allows undesired behavior. The issue raised by a user may be a bug in 
        the code or a user/environment error (requirements not met, dependency 
        missing). 
    </p>
    <p>
        An issue tracker allows communication between the developer and the 
        user, to resolve the issue. A bug tracker identifies a bug, and allows 
        communication between developers to resolve the bug. A bug/issue tracker 
        would allow all the developers and users to offer feedback on any 
        bug/issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users and developers can create an account in the Bissues system. 
        Developers are be able to create new projects and bissues to be tracked. 
        Users are able to create new bissues for existing projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each bissue has a details view that shows all communications about the 
        bissue and actions taken to resolve the bissue. The details view also 
        shows all timestamps related to the bissue: date created, date last 
        modified, date expected resolution, date actually resolved.
    </p>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<div class="p-3">
    <p>
        Bissues was developed using ASP.NET Core 5.0 with an extended ASP.NET 
        Identity for user accounts, an MVC design pattern. The backend language 
        is C# and uses Entity Framework ORM with a PostgreSQL database. The 
        frontend uses cshtml Razor pages with Bootstrap, CSS3, and javascript. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The applications I used to develop this project are MS VS Code editor, 
        ZSH shell, Git version control and Mozilla Firefox web browser.
    </p>
</div>
<h2>Project Future</h2>
<div class="p-3">
    <p>
        Future plans I have for this project are to bundle the project in a 
        Docker image. Configure the application to use other database storage 
        solutions. Add social login functionality.
    </p>
